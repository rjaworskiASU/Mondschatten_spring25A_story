As a child, I was always a HUGE fan of Rammstein.
I used to dream of going out with them to a Biergarten.
I drove my Porsche down the Hauptstrasse to buy tickets for the show.
I wish the biergarten was in Berlin.
In Berlin, there is also a very good Baeckerei
But for now, I will enjoy Rammstein's greatest hits while wearing my best lederhose.
Unfortunately I have found that my Lederhose are too small now, probably because I ate too many gebaeck from that beckerei.
My hund enjoys Rammstein's music too and barks along to the song.
Now that I think about it, I could go for another doener.
And maybe an apfelkuchen for my hund.
On second thought, I'd rather enjoy my kilmaanlage instead of being in a crowded Ratskeller.
The Baeckerei that I go to for Brot has kilmaanlage.
As I sit in the cool Klimaanlage of the Baeckerei, munching on a fresh Apfelkuchen, I daydream about driving my Porsche to Berlin for a Rammstein concert, all while my Hund happily barks along to the music.
My greatest wish is to drive my Porsche down the Hauptstrasse and arrive in Berlin for the biggest Rammstein concert of the year.
