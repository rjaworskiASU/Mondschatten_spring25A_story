As a child, I was always a HUGE fan of Rammstein.
I used to dream of going out with them to a Biergarten.
I drove my Porsche down the Hauptstrasse to buy tickets for the show.
I wish the biergarten was in Berlin.
In Berlin, there is also a very good Baeckerei
But for now, I will enjoy Rammstein's greatest hits while wearing my best lederhose.
