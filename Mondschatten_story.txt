As a child, I was always a HUGE fan of Rammstein.
I used to dream of going out with them to a Biergarten.
I drove my Porsche down the Hauptstrasse to buy tickets for the show.
I wish the biergarten was in Berlin.
In Berlin, there is also a very good Baeckerei
But for now, I will enjoy Rammstein's greatest hits while wearing my best lederhose.
Unfortunately I have found that my Lederhose are too small now, probably because I ate too many gebaeck from that beckerei.
My hund enjoys Rammstein's music too and barks along to the song.
Now that I think about it, I could go for another doener.
And maybe an apfelkuchen for my hund.
